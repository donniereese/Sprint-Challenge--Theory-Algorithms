# Analysis of Algorithms

## Exercise I. 
_Give an analysis of the running time with respect to the input size n of each of the following program fragments below:_

a. **Answer: ** O(n)
```a = 0;
   
```
   ### Analysis:
   The tricky part for me was that you are comparing against n^3, however running you would only complete _n_ cycles. This 
   means that the time grows with n.
b.
